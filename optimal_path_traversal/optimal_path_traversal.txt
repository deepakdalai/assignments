You are given a 2D matrix size N X M of positive integers. A journey starts from the top left cell (0, 0) and reaches the bottom right cell (N - 1, M - 1). You can only go down or move right from a cell. You cannot go left or up. The value of every cell you visit gets added to the cost of the journey. You need to return the following:

1. Total cost for the most efficient journey (Least cost)
2. The actual moves involved in making that journey 

Example:

6   9   9   9   9   9
1   3   9   1   9   9
9   1   1   2   9   9
9   9   9   1   9   9
9   9   9   1   9   9
9   9   9   1   1   1


Total Min Cost: 19

Input shall be provided as a single string of character where '/' separates the rows and '|' separated values. The matrix above shall hence be provided as following in input:
6|9|9|9|9|9/1|3|9|1|9|9/9|1|1|2|9|9/9|9|9|1|9|9/9|9|9|1|9|9/9|9|9|1|1|1
